First keynote presentation (“Thinking about Vector Symbolic
Architectures”) for the [Midnight Sun Workshop on Vector Symbolic
Architectures](https://sites.google.com/ltu.se/midnightvsa/home?authuser=0),
June 15-16 2023, Luleå, Sweden.

This repository is structured as an [R
project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) containing the
source and rendered versions of the presentation. The source is a
[Quarto presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

The versions of all the packages used to create this presentation have
been recorded with the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package.

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` is you can include R chunks. -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. -->
<!-- An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots. -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
