"Elements are random projections from latent vector space to observable space"
"Each element is consistent with many latent vectors (50% for BSC etc.)"
"Multiple elements determine intersection of sets of compatible latent vectors"
"Elements are ""witnesses"""
"Each witness is independent of all the others (except via relationship to latent vector)"
"therefore no hypervector is distinguished"
"No witness  is distinguished"
"therefore only relationships between hypervectors are important"
"operations, items in cleanup, etc"
"Hypervector as proxy for latent vector"
"VSA circuits determine relationships between latent vectors?"
"the hypervectors are a noisy realisation of the latent vectors (not so much necessary as a reminder of noise and approximation)"
"real, MAP, BSC isomorphic to various discretisation of phase"
"phasor is the general case (probably)"
"Laiho et al is a phasor set representation"
"Understand at element level"
"I have no idea about Czachor & Aerts geometric algebra"
"euclidean distance is translation invariant and doesn't allow negative values"
"similarity measure"
"must be vector similarity"
"similarity is average over elements"
"average of per element similarity"
"doesn't need to be canonical"
"Miracle of performance with no permutation"
"small truth tables for simple circuits - so why hyperdimensional?"
"not necessarily correct"
"only needs to be large enough to be useful"
"not necessarily internally consistent"
"make representational space large enough"
"it's a bet"
"aim to be productive"
"Conceptual framework"
"limited role of dimensionality"
"sufficient concentration of measure to distinguish import hypotheses"
"algebraic equality for free (e.g. commutativity)"
"lots of interacting issues, so no clear flow or hierarchy"
"eventually get duplicate directions"
"especially given some noise"
"longer labels are more crowded"
"suggests an inductive bias in generative systems (Occam's razor)"
"direction as composite label"
"nonzero similarity only relevant in hemsisphere"
"analogue wire interpretation of hypervector"
"binding & permutation are ""more"" important"
"map of operations on hypersphere"
"vast majority of transforms have no similarity effect"
"something like edit distance ""more"" important"
"but everythuing is only one step away by binding"
