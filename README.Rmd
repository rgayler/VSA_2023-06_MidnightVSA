## Project structure

This repository is structured as an [R project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) containing the source and rendered versions of the presentation.
The source is a [Quarto presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

I assume you know how to run an R project, so won't go through all the details of installation.

The versions of all the packages used to create this presentation have been recorded with the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package.
To re-run the source code you will need to have `renv` installed. 
Call `renv::restore()` from within the project to install all the versions of the packages used in this project.

The `assets/` directory contains the images used in the slides.

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` is you can include R chunks. -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. -->

<!-- An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots. -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
