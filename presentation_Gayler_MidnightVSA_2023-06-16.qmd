## Motivation

-   How far would you get with knowing the definitions of the VSA operators and *nothing* else?
    -   Like having axioms and no other maths knowledge
-   Everyone has a web of auxiliary *beliefs* around VSA:
    -   About VSA and relationships to other things they know

    -   Used to reason about their VSA knowledge and its implications, so is central to applying and extending VSA
-   The objective is that the auxiliary beliefs should be *productive* for applying and extending VSA

## Limitations

Auxiliary beliefs are:

-   Not necessarily true
-   Not necessarily even true or false (e.g. metaphors)
-   Not necessarily coherent
-   Not stable over time. Think of them as evolving frameworks.
-   Likely to be idiosyncratic (If they were canonical they would be VSA theory)

Think of them as gambles.
You are betting that they will be more productive than alternatives you might entertain.

## (dis)Organisation of the talk

-   I am talking about my conceptual framework

    -   I have no idea what yours is, because we don't discuss it

    -   This may be painfully obvious to you.
        I apologise.

-   Framework is densely connected web of interrelated points

    -   No simple, logical, explanatory path through that web

    -   Any path is necessarily a random-ish ramble.
        I apologise.

    -   Argument is necessarily by hand waving (modus waftens)

-   Pick some apparently salient points, wander in their neighbourhoods, point out some more distant relations

# Analogue wire interpretation

# Miracle of emergent computation

# Hypervectors are row vectors

# Permutation and indices

# Understand everything at the element level

# Dimensionality and constraints
